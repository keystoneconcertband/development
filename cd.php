					<li><h3>The Klaxon <a id="m1" class="audio" href="media/01.mp3">The Klaxon</a></h3>
					Composer Henry Fillmore's career spanned more than 50 years, 
						and he probably wrote and arranged more band music than anyone 
						in the history of the art. It is estimated that he wrote 250 
						original compositions for band and arranged another 750. This 
						piece reportedly was written to honor the klaxon automobile 
						horn. It was arranged by Frederick Fennell, an internationally-acclaimed 
						conductor who is widely regarded as the leader of the wind ensemble 
						movement in this country.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Emperata Overture <a id="m2" class="audio" href="media/02.mp3">Emperata Overture</a></h3>
						"Emperata Overture" was Claude Smith's first composition, published 
						in 1964. Smith, a Missouri native, composed instrumental and 
						choral music extensively, and his works have been performed 
						by leading musical organizations throughout the world. He has 
						more than 110 band works, 12 orchestral works, and 15 choral 
						works to his credit, along with solos for artists such as Doc 
						Severinsen, Dale Underwood, Brian Bowman, Warren Covington, 
						Gary Foster, Rich Matteson, and Steve Seward.<br />
						<br />
						He received numerous commissions, including works for the U.S. 
						Air Force Band, the U.S. Marine Band, the U.S. Navy Band, and 
						the Army Field Band. His composition "Flight" was adopted as 
						the official march of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, 
						DC.
					</li>
					<li><h3>The Conqueror <a id="m3" class="audio" href="media/03.mp3">The Conqueror</a></h3>
						Carl Teike was the fourth child of 14 born to a blacksmith. 
						He began his musical education at the age of 14 and played many 
						instruments, including French horn, bass violin, and percussion. 
						At 19, he joined the 123rd Konig Karl Regiment as a musician. 
						Stationed in Ulm, he supplemented his pay by playing French 
						horn and percussion with local theater orchestras. He also composed 
						and earned respect as a composer of marches. When he departed 
						from military service, he became a policeman in Ulm and married 
						the daughter of his landlord. In 1895, he moved his family to 
						Potsdam, a suburb of Berlin, where he served with the Royal 
						Police until 1908. At that time, serious illness forced his 
						resignation, and after recovering, he took a position with the 
						Landsberg post office. The people of Landsberg erected a beautiful 
						monument in his memory. Teike wrote more than 100 marches and 
						at least 20 concert works.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Malague <a id="m4" class="audio" href="media/04.mp3">Malague&#241;a</a></h3>
						Composer Ernesto Lecuona is a major, if not well-known, figure 
						in popular music of this century. He brought the first successful 
						Latin orchestra to the United States, fostered the careers of 
						many of the most influential artists in Latin music, and composed 
						many of its most enduring songs. He achieved the rare distinction 
						of both popular and critical success, competing with the best 
						of Tin Pan Alley as a songwriter while at the same time making 
						his mark as a contemporary classical composer. Malague√±a, his 
						first major composition, was introduced by Lecuona at New York's 
						Roxy Theatre in 1927.					
					</li>
					<li><h3>March of the Belgian Paratroopers  (Marche des Parachutistes Belges)
						<a id="m5" class="audio" href="media/05.mp3">March of the Belgian Paratroopers</a></h3>
						Born in Schaarbeek, Belgium, in 1897, Pierre Leemans studied 
						piano, harmony, orchestration, and composition and began his 
						teaching career in 1917 at the Etterbeek Music Academy. At 22, 
						he served his year of military duty and then returned to teach 
						music until 1932, when he became the pianist- conductor-program 
						director for the official broadcasting company, N.I.R. In 1934, 
						he won the composition contest for the official march of the 
						1935 Brussels World Exposition. He founded the Schaarbeek High 
						School Choir in 1940 and won a composition contest for school 
						songs three years later. From entries by 109 anonymous composers, 
						works by Leemans were selected for first and second prize for 
						the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. After a lifetime of composing, 
						teaching, performing, and conducting, he died in 1980 at the 
						age of eighty-two. <br />
						<br />
						While he was serving his year of military duty at the end of 
						World War I, Leemans' regimental commander asked him to compose 
						a march; it was begun, but never finished. Near the end of World 
						War II, he was having dinner with a group of paratroopers and 
						was again asked to compose a march. As the group commander drove 
						him home that night, the march theme came back to his mind, 
						and he wrote out all of the parts for the official "March of 
						the Belgian Paratroopers" after reaching home. A quiet, unaggressive 
						essay in the easy-paced European style, it is set in the form 
						of a "patrol," in which the music marches on from the distance, 
						plays, and passes. This arrangement was made by Charles Wiley 
						at the request of his Lamar (Texas) University Band students 
						for the first U.S. performance of the march.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Gillette Look Sharp March <a id="m6" class="audio" href="media/06.mp3">Gillette Look Sharp March</a></h3>
						Hailing from Centralia, Washington, Mahlon Merrick was graduated 
						from Washington State University in 1923 with bachelors' degrees 
						in both education and music. After a brief teaching experience 
						in schools in Redmond, Washington, Merrick devoted himself to 
						a career in music.<br />
						<br />
						His career led him to Hollywood, where he was associated with 
						a number of popular television series including The George Burns 
						and Gracie Allen Show and The Bob Cummings Show. For 30 years, 
						he was musical director for comedian Jack Benny. The "Gillette 
						Look Sharp March" and the "Washington State University Cougar 
						Marching Song" are among Merrick's best-known compositions. 
						Merrick also composed music used in NFL for many years into 
						the early 1990s.<br />
						<br />
						If the melody of this song sounds familiar, it may be because 
						of the many places it has been used. Originally conceived as 
						an advertising jingle for the Gillette company for "The Gillette 
						Cavalcade of Sports" on NBC in the mid-1940s, it was later used 
						as the theme song for "The Friday Night Fights." Expanded to 
						the full march version recorded here, it has become a popular 
						tune among marching bands and even pops orchestras. Various 
						other uses have been made of the melody, including a Cub Scout 
						song and the main theme to a boxing video game called "Punch 
						Out!!"
					</li>
					<li><h3>The Light Eternal/Amazing Grace <a id="m7" class="audio" href="media/07.mp3">The Light Eternal/Amazing Grace</a></h3>
						One of James Swearingen's best-known works is "The Light Eternal." 
						Based on the hymn "God Of Our Fathers," this moving piece tells 
						the story of the S.S. Dorchester that sank off the coast of 
						Greenland, killing more than 600 passengers. Four chaplains 
						of various faiths gave their life jackets to others and then 
						went down with the ship, standing on the deck with their arms 
						linked. Those chaplains were Lt. George L. Fox, Methodist; Lt. 
						Alexander D. Goode, Jewish; Lt. John P. Washington, Roman Catholic; 
						and Lt. Clark V. Poling, Dutch Reformed. This dramatic and emotional 
						work tells a story of tragedy and then of tribute to the heroes 
						that gave up their own lives to help others. <br />
						<br />
						We've made it into a medley with the popular folk hymn "Amazing 
						Grace," credited to John Newton. Newton was born in London, 
						England, in 1725, began sailing with his father at age 11, and 
						became a captain of a slave ship as an adult. Although Newton 
						had had some early religious instruction from his mother, who 
						had died when he was a child, he had long since given up any 
						religious convictions. However, on a homeward voyage, while 
						he was attempting to steer the ship through a violent storm, 
						he experienced what he was to refer to later as his "great deliverance." 
						He recorded in his journal that when all seemed lost and the 
						ship would surely sink, he exclaimed, "Lord, have mercy upon 
						us." <br />
						<br />
						Later in his cabin he reflected on what he had said and began 
						to believe that God had addressed him through the storm and 
						that grace had begun to work for him. Newton remained a slave 
						captain for a while after the date that he celebrated each year 
						as his conversion, but he saw to it that the slaves were treated 
						humanely. He later became a minister and wrote many hymns and 
						songs for his weekly services. <br />

					<li><h3>Fanfare, Hymn, and Dedication <a id="m8" class="audio" href="media/08.mp3">Fanfare, Hymn, and Dedication</a></h3>
						Critics say that "Fanfare, Hymn, and Dedication," a dynamic 
						concert piece by composer Ed Huckeby, is destined to become 
						a staple for leading concert bands and wind ensembles. The three 
						contrasting sections contain the exceptional writing and scoring 
						that people have come to expect from this composer. <br />
						<br />
						Huckeby is associate vice president for academic affairs at 
						Northeastern State University in Oklahoma. He has been administrator 
						for Tulsa Ballet Theater and is emeritus professor of music 
						at Northeastern State University, where he was music department 
						chairman and dean of the graduate school for 22 years. Before 
						coming to Northeastern, Huckeby taught instrumental music for 
						eight years in the Oklahoma public schools. He has been recognized 
						internationally as an outstanding music educator and composer 
						of nearly 100 published works for concert and marching bands.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Amparito Roca <a id="m9" class="audio" href="media/09.mp3">Amparito Roca</a></h3>
						Jaime Texidor Dalmau was a composer, conductor, and publisher 
						who lived most of his life in Baracaldo, a city in northern 
						Spain. He was born in Barcelona in 1885, and it is said that 
						he played saxophone in a military band for several years. In 
						1927, he became the conductor of the Baracaldo municipal band, 
						a position he held until 1936. Over this period, he composed 
						so much band music that he established his own publishing company. 
						Many of his compositions were in the Paso Doble genre, including 
						"Amparito Roca," which is one of the most well known of its 
						kind in the North American band repertoire. <br />
						<br />
						There is some mystery attached to "Amparito Roca:" although 
						Texidor's name is on this edition, the music reportedly was 
						written by British bandmaster Reginald Ridewood. Texidor arranged 
						the piece for publication by Musica Moderna in Madrid in 1936, 
						but the original score by Ridewood -- under another name -- 
						was performed in England before the copyright date. It is assumed 
						that Ridewood wrote the music but failed to apply for a copyright 
						and Texidor rearranged the piece for Spanish bands and reissued 
						it under copyright as his composition.
					</li>
					<li><h3>New York: 1927 <a id="m10" class="audio" href="media/10.mp3">New York: 1927</a></h3>
						It's 1927 in New York City. The Holland Tunnel has just opened, 
						connecting Manhattan with Jersey City, New Jersey, allowing 
						cars to travel under the Hudson River instead of relying solely 
						on ferry boats. Charles Lindbergh makes his first solo nonstop 
						trans-Atlantic flight from New York to Paris, and Al Jolson 
						is entertaining in the first full-length talking motion picture, 
						"The Jazz Singer."<br />
						<br />
						"New York: 1927," by composer Warren Barker, re-creates the 
						sounds of New York in 1927, with its ragtime and blues themes 
						and its sounds of the city. Pay special attention to the sounds 
						of police whistles and car horns as people race out of the Holland 
						Tunnel onto the streets of Manhattan.<br />
						<br />
						Barker was born in Oakland, California, in 1923. At age 24 he 
						was appointed chief arranger for The Railroad Hour, NBC's prime 
						musical program. He also was associated with 20th Century Fox, 
						Columbia, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios as composer/conductor 
						for motion pictures and television.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Themes Like Old Times <a id="m11" class="audio" href="media/11.mp3">Themes Like Old Times</a></h3>
						Another piece by Warren Barker, this one is an arrangement of 
						several old-time tunes in a medley he calls "Themes Like Old 
						Times." You'll hear "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Peg O' My Heart," 
						"I Want A Girl," "By the Light of the Silvery Moon," and "12th 
						Street Rag."
					</li>
					<li><h3>National Emblem <a id="m12" class="audio" href="media/12.mp3">National Emblem</a></h3>
						Famed bandmaster Frederick Fennell said "National Emblem" is 
						as perfect as a march can be. It was written in the early 1900s 
						by E. E. Bagley, an obscure New England composer of patriotic 
						tunes, and has been a standard American march ever since.
					</li>
					<li><h3>America, the Beautiful <a id="m13" class="audio" href="media/13.mp3">America, the Beautiful</a></h3>
						Teacher Katherine Bates wrote the original words to "America, 
						the Beautiful" in 1893 after a trip to 14,000-foot-high Pikes 
						Peak. She revised the words twice. More than 60 different musical 
						settings have been written for Bates' words, but this one by 
						Samuel Augustus Ward is the most popular. The arrangement is 
						by Carmen Dragon, an Oscar- and Emmy-award-winning composer 
						and orchestrator known for his rich, lush arrangements that 
						convey the emotion of the music to audiences.
					</li>
					<li><h3>American Patrol <a id="m14" class="audio" href="media/14.mp3">American Patrol</a></h3>
						F. W. Meachem usually worked as an arranger, rather than a composer, 
						producing arrangements for Victor Herbert musicals and Stephen 
						Foster songs. Written in 1885, "American Patrol" was very popular 
						before World War I. The first recording of it was a two-minute 
						Edison cylinder in 1903. It retained its popularity during both 
						world wars. In World War II, the arrangement by dance band leader 
						Glenn Miller was especially significant.
					</li>
					<li><h3>Stars and Stripes Forever <a id="m15" class="audio" href="media/15.mp3">Stars and Stripes Forever</a></h3>
						This John Philip Sousa classic has been designated America's 
						official march by the Congress of the United States. Sousa believed 
						that the piece was divinely inspired. It came to him as he sailed 
						home from vacationing in Europe after learning of his manager's 
						death. When he reached shore, he wrote "down the measures that 
						my brain-band had been playing for me, and not a note of it 
						has ever been changed." The original manuscript is in the Library 
						of Congress and bears the inscription "J.P.S., Xmas, 1896."
